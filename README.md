Rotating arrows of different sizes and speeds can approximate any shape. More of these arrows will result in a more accurate shape while less will result in a slighty worse, more artistic shape. This is "Fourier series" and it's visualized by this program in a clean way.


You can import an svg to trace or draw your own straight to the canvas. Note that the svg should only contain a single line.
